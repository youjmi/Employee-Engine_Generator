 ## Description

 Welcome! I would like to present to you my Employee Engine!

 Here is my link : https://github.com/youjmi/Employee-Engine_Generator


 Here is the link to my video tutorial: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wxurMJjvb-i9l85msngRN1PBPsV9LHCn/view


 This Homework Assigment is a software engineering team generator! With this application, you will be able to navigate with ease and built your Team into an automatically generated html file!

## Installation 

Please install the following

```
npm i inquirer --save
```

The Inquirer will prompt inputs in your terminal.

Then application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node app.js
```

## Usage

Once that is invoked, the user's terminal will proceed with a variety of different questions that will help create your Team profile.  I have added the validate function to about 90% of my messages, ensuring that important information isn't skipped

``` 
validate: (Function)
```

When the user completes adding the employees and choose "None" as their option, then a new folder  "output" and a new html "team.html" will be created!
